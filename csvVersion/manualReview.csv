Thanks for your interest in my group and for introducing yourself. I'd be glad to get together and talk about the kinds of things we're up to. Please contact my assistant Lori Federico, and ask her to find an hour in my schedule -- perhaps over lunch -- some time in the next couple of weeks.

Hello Paul,

  My name is Steve Carter and I am one of the first year graduate students. I hope my message finds you well. I am writing to express a formal interest in your research, specifically your theoretical work in the quantum mechanics of fluids and solids. I don't know if you are planning to take on any new graduate students this year, but I would love to find out more about your research. Of course, if you do foresee having an availability of funds for taking on a graduate student for dissertation research I would be quite interested to discover that as well. If you are available this week or sometime soon I would love to arrange a time to meet with you and discuss it. Even if you do not plan to have funds for another graduate student next year, I would still really love to speak with you because I really want to conduct research in theoretical quantum mechanics and I am sure that you would be a great source of advice on how I can make this happen.

  A bit about me. I studied both physics and mathematics as an undergraduate at the small liberal arts school Birmingham-Southern College. I love mathematical formalism and make every attempt to be very detailed in my work and understand concepts at the most fundamental level I can. My research experience as an undergraduate consisted primarily of experimental nuclear physics (REU, Duke university) and theoretical work in pure mathematics (specifically, abstract algebra) and I feel that theoretical work is my passion and the path I would like to pursue in graduate school. I have provided my CV and resume should you chose to review them.


I look forward to hearing from you,

Best,
Steve Carter","","","Normal","False","Normal","2"

Subject: Big Data and the College of Science
Dear Paul,
 
You may know I have been having various discussions with a number of faculty across campus regarding “big data” and the potential benefits of creating an interdisciplinary research institute in this area. Pablo has been actively engaged in these discussions, and has been very helpful in this regard.
 
Would it be possible for Pablo and I to schedule a meeting with you to discuss this subject?
 
Looking forward to your response.

Paul and Dian, for your calendar, this will confirm a brief intrusion in your regular meeting schedule on the morning of Monday, November 3 for a quick hello to Dr. Jerry Staton, Director of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Emory and one of Charlie Liotta's former students, at the outset of his campus visit. I'd like you to see him at about 9:05am for seven minutes or so. We then do a campus tour and go to Chem/Biochem where he meets with M.G. Finn, pre-health students, biomedical faculty...and of course, has private time with Dr. Liotta. Thanks, -Art

WHAT IS NEF? Throughout America’s history, engineers have provided a wellspring of innovation to drive our economic growth and national security. The U.S. engineering enterprise is facing a crisis of capacity, capability and competitiveness - the 3 C's.

CAPACITY: America needs quantity, quality and diversity in the engineering workforce, including homegrown talent to fill critical national security roles. Young people are not entering engineering fields in sufficient numbers to replace retiring engineers. 
 
CAPABILITY: America needs skilled engineers versed in multiple disciplines. Emerging, multidisciplinary engineering and technology fields need a workforce trained to solve challenges in sustainability, climate change and evolving areas such as cyber-security, advanced manufacturing, cloud architecture, energy and healthcare.
 
COMPETITIVENESS: The engineering enterprise is the underpinning of America’s productivity and prosperity. The engineering community must work more creatively and collaboratively – alongside political leaders and media – and make the case for the essential role engineering plays in fueling our economy, bolstering national security and advancing U.S. leadership.
 
The National Engineering Forum is a movement focused on creating solutions for the three challenges facing the U.S. engineering enterprise. In 2014, leaders from industry, academia, the national laboratories and other sectors will meet in engineering and innovation hubs such as the Atlanta region to celebrate this heritage, and launch a national conversation – the National Engineering Forum – on the future of America’s engineering enterprise and the role of engineers to position the nation for 21st century leadership. The dialogues will culminate in a national cornerstone event.

Concerning parking, I have reached out to see if we can use the lower parking lot at the President's Residence, but have not received confirmation.  I will forward approval to park in this lot as soon as I receive word. Other options for parking is the State Street parking deck and also some street parking may be available for those that have a business parking pass.


John Duconge, GT’s EBB project manager, and  a representative from CPSM will lead us on a hard hat tour of EBB.

Just a few of the safety rules:
•         no skirts allowed
•         hard sole shoes/ no open toes
•         safety vest, safety glasses, and hard hat are required (can be borrowed from the McCarthy trailer)","EBB Construction trailer site, entrance at Atlantic and 10th ","","Normal","False","Normal","1"

We are honored to feature Dr. Stamatios Krimigis who will present, ""The Voyager spacecraft after 37 years in space: The quest for traveling beyond our solar system"" which will provide discussion of an array of fascinating highlights of over 30 years of scientific discoveries.
 Dr. Stamatios Krimigis is Principal Investigator on several NASA spacecraft, including Voyagers 1 and 2 to the Outer Planets and the Voyager Interstellar Mission, and the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. He and colleagues proposed and implemented the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission and oversaw its landing on the asteroid Eros on February 12, 2000, the first ever landing on an asteroid. He has designed and built instruments that have flown to all eight planets, and also the New Horizons mission currently headed to Pluto. 
Dr. Stamatios Krimigis received his B.S. Physics from the University of Minnesota (1961), his M.S. (1963) and Ph.D. (1965) in Physics from the University of Iowa, and served on the faculty there. In 1968 he moved to the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University, became Chief Scientist in 1980, Space Department Head in 1991, and Emeritus Head in 2004. The Space Department has designed, built and operated more than 65 spacecraft, and expanded its activities to planetary missions during his tenure.
He has published more than 560 papers in peer-reviewed journals and books on the physics of the sun, interplanetary medium, planetary magnetospheres, and the heliosphere, with over 11,000 citations. He is recipient of NASA’s Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal three times (1981, 1986, 2014), is a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), American Geophysical Union (AGU), American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), recipient of COSPAR’s Space Science Award in 2002, a recipient of the Basic Sciences Award of the International Academy of Astronautics (1994) where he chairs the Board of Trustees for Basic Sciences, awardee of the Council of European Aerospace Societies CEAS Gold Medal for 2011, recipient of the Jean Dominique Cassini Medal of the European Geophysical Union, the AIAA James Van Allen Space Environments Medal, both for 2014, a member of the Academy of Athens since 2005 occupying the Chair of “Science of Space”, and chairman of Greece’s National Council of Research and Technology (2010-2013). He holds Honorary Doctorates from the Universities of the Aegean, Athens, and the International Hellenic University.

Subject: NSF NRT Proposal....Season Opens

A reminder to please RSVP to Angie Beggs so we can get a head count for the sandwiches.

The main thing to accomplish is finding one or more shared science visions to go with a training/outreach vision. This meeting is just with the people who were on the NRT proposal last year (or should have been, in the case of Paul Goldbart). The general idea is a GTPN/Soft Materials support group to develop good NRT proposals (as a reminder, NRT is the new IGERT). If more than one idea emerges, great: the competition is OFF campus (or at least outside of GTPN/Soft). Within our group, we can help each other.

David B cannot attend…misunderstanding about how the poll, perhaps…but we will fill him in later.

Subject: NSF NRT Proposal....Season Opens (and, yes, another Doodle poll)

Hello, you have received this because of your participation in last year’s rush-job NSF-NRT proposal, or because you have expressed interest.

The distribution list does not yet include our off-campus participants. Additional people may be added…a group decision.

NRT is the successor to IGERT. This year, we have the opportunity to do better. Our educational plan has been refined, but we still need a better scientific focus. To find a time that works for regular planning meetings, I have established a Doodle poll.

http://doodle.com/f6rq3yxa8z656rxp

IT IS NOT THE USUAL “AVAILABLE TIMES” POLL, BUT THE NEGATIVE OF THAT. PLEASE MARK DOWN YOUR REGULAR WEEKLY SCHEDULE: TEACHING, GROUP MEETING, SEMINARS, WHATEVER. THE WEEK INDICATED IN THE POLL IS ARBITRARY. ALSO, THE FRIDAY 10 PM TIME SLOT IS ACCIDENTAL…IGNORE THAT!

Below is the last email about NRT from last year, complete with the internal reviews. I take them as mostly positive, and the problems are fixable. NSF lists NRT as “anticipated” but last year’s RFP has not been updated. It does not matter: surely there will be some competition for the IGERT successor.

******************************************************************

We were not selected for NRT. It’s easy to understand: thanks to spotty delivery of the memo about an internal deadline, and not being aggressive enough to find out sooner, we wrote this in < 24 hours and barely made an EXTENDED deadline. Not enough time to put down the ideas we had in our concept meetings. If we had been selected, other teams could have complained! So this could have been DOA and OSP was just smart enough to let us get some feedback.

Good news: The reviews express enthusiasm for the general idea. In some cases—inclusion of people from other departments—we probably all agree with the reviewers. In other cases, we will want to sharpen our arguments. With regular meetings and attention to the positive suggestions we will be in good shape to try again.

I was pleased to see the importance the reviewers placed on working with other universities. Because of APTEC, we in the needless (see last reviewer) polymer subfield of soft matter are especially well prepared for this. Also, some of our regional, friendly universities are masters of outreach efforts to all manner of under-served groups.

The future looks good for a program that can make a difference in the Southeast and beyond.

Thanks to everyone for their input.

Reviewer feedback (7 reviewers studied 3 proposals): Color annotations added by PR <<<with lessons.

  This proposal is brimming with enthusiasm and seems to hold much potential. The research area is under-described here, but the earlier reviews indicate that we can count on it to be a strength of any final proposal. The disciplinary range is pretty narrow. The ""innovative"" focus appears to be problem-focused and hands-on; but what does this mean on the ground? There appear to be no partners outside GT, and the plan for diversity is pretty much non-existent. On the basis of excitement and vision, I really liked this proposal.
  Solid proposal well aligned with initiatives here at Georgia Tech. Appears to be based on a previous that reviewed well.
  Consider adding some physicists to the participating faculty list? Seems like this would enhance the breadth of the program and bring together relevant ""community"" members related to soft matter.
  The program is strongly interdisciplinary and the idea of building a community is appealing. Broader impact beyond GT is not described. Description of anticipated problems and examples of projects indicate some thoughts went into planning. Some good ideas also went into metrics for assessment. Management plans are not included. Pre-proposal seems to have be jargony; risky in an actual proposal.
  Some very interesting ideas. However they need to be better fleshed out, with better documented support from the institute for sustainability. The ""clear and viable plan"" isn't there yet.
  PCS is a novel, bold and interesting concept with ""sample challenges"" from industry. The text includes seemingly inappropriate criticism of mission-oriented research. Inclusion of IGERT expertise is useful. Majority of funds will support graduate fellows, which is good. No inclusion of business or social science issues.
  Need to strengthen interdisciplinarity of the team/research foci; lack of BME and low ChBE representation on PI list; the need for an NRT in this area has not been well-developed, beyond the recent internal PTFE/MSE merger

From the proposal itself: Partners will include ORNL, SSRL and NIST (members not shown). <<<The lesson for us: show them prominently!

We had just one, Alberto Fernandez-Nieves, and we do need more. Next time for sure! Goldbart is a natural, but participation could put him in a compromised position. There are others… <<<<GTPN still growing. 

What? They missed the one line we snuck into the budget justification? <<<Too little time makes anyone look like an amateur.

Mission-oriented research is a matter of balance: NIH, DOE, DARPA, NIST and others have mission-oriented research covered; a real problem with IGERT was that it accidentally turned the one remaining agency for discovery-driven research into mission-oriented. Simultaneously, it also created new divisions to replace the old ones. The new guidelines INVITE a curriculum-based approach instead of (or supplemental to) a mission-based approach because curricula have staying power and can be inclusive, even as they foster research that is not so different than single-PI research. Part of the reason for the change in the guidelines is because we told them it was needed. <<<<But…the reviewer’s comments point out we must be careful.","MRDC 3510","","Normal","False","Normal","2"

Cooperative Function in Atomically Precise Nanoscale Assemblies
 
Abstract
We use molecular design, tailored syntheses, intermolecular interactions, and selective chemistry to direct molecules into desired positions to create nanostructures, to connect functional molecules to the outside world, and to serve as test structures for measuring single or bundled molecules. Interactions within and between molecules can be designed, directed, measured, understood, and exploited at unprecedented scales. Such interactions can be used to form precise molecular assemblies, nanostructures, and patterns, and to control and to stabilize function. We selectively test hypothesized mechanisms by varying molecular design, chemical environment, and measurement conditions to enable or to disable function and control using predictive and testable means. Critical to understanding these variations has been developing the means to make tens to hundreds of thousands of independent single-molecule/assembly measurements in order to develop sufficiently significant statistical distributions, while retaining the heterogeneity inherent in the measurements. We measure the electronic coupling of the molecules and substrates by measuring the polarizabilities of the connected functional molecules. The next step in such devices is to learn to assemble and to operate molecules together, both cooperatively and hierarchically, in analogy to biological muscles. We discuss our initial efforts in this area, in which we find both interferences and cooperativity.","MoSE G011","","Normal","False","Normal","2"

On behalf of the entire volunteer membership of the Steering Committee for CAMPAIGN GEORGIA TECH, we are delighted to congratulate you and your academic and development teams on reaching your goal of eighty million dollars a full year ahead of schedule. The College of Sciences becomes the second college to cross the finish line.

 

Even with the recent commitments tied to EBB, and estate gift provisions from multiple donors, including those in honor of Charlie Liotta and to advance public science outreach, we are sure that the College has funding opportunities still unmet in the current campaign period and for which the College will be focused in the remaining months of CAMPAIGN GEORGIA TECH – most likely in the form of an endowed Dean’s Chair, an expanded number of endowed school chairs, faculty chairs and professorships, undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships, and perhaps dean’s discretionary endowment funds. Please know that the Steering Committee and each of us stand ready to assist you in making even further progress beyond this success in support of the philanthropic opportunities remaining.

 

We wonder if you and your academic and development leadership would join the members of the Campaign Steering Committee when we next meet on the morning of Friday, March 6 at 7:15am, in the Global Learning Center, where we will take a few moments to appropriately recognize and celebrate the accomplishment, and you might share a few minutes on goals remaining for the College of Sciences?

 

With best personal regards, and our congratulations to the entire College of Sciences community.

We would be happy to host a number of CTCA physicians, researchers, and administrators in order to give them a sense of future potential opportunities for collaboration.


Our plan is to have a meeting that consists of:

- lunch with introductions and welcome

- 2-2.5 hours of very short presentations showcasing Georgia Tech cancer research and future plans in the College of Sciences, with question & answer period and break

- 1.5 hours of open discussion of future opportunities. 


Please let us know if you or Dr. Daneker have any suggestions! Once we have a final date from you, we'll plan the speakers.


Best wishes,
